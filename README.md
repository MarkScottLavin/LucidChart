# LucidChart
LucidChart, currently in alpha-stage, is an application (and potentially library) I'm continuing to develop using Javascript and THREE.js, for desktop, mobile, and soon mixed-reality. Initially conceived as a means to teach myself these tools, the project has gained a life of it's own as a means to turn math and data into something expressive, immersive, informative and beautiful.
